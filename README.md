# Welcome to My Mouse
***

## Task
The task is figure out how to find the shortest way according to the given map using specific algorythms and print it out.

## Description
It comes out there is a "Lee algorythm" that deals with exactly this kinda problems. I used that algorythm by converting the given map into matrix. (The reason there are submits only by me, not also by my partner, We only coded on the same laptop and my profile.)

## Installation
There no need to perform complex actions. It is enough to just pull or download it and "make" the target.

## Usage
You pass the map's name as an argument. If the map is valid it prints out the shortest path from the point 1 to the point 2 by character 'o'.
```
./my_mouse path_to_a_map_file
