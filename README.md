# Welcome to My Mouse
***

## Task
The task is to figure out how to find the shortest way according to the given map using specific algorithms and print it out.

## Description
It comes out there is a "Lee algorithm" that deals with exactly this kinda of problem. I used that algorithm by converting the given map into the matrix. (The reason they are submitted only by me, not also by my partner, We only coded on the same laptop and my profile.)

## Installation
There is no need to perform complex actions. It is enough to just pull or download it and "make" the target.

## Usage
You pass the map's name as an argument. If the map is valid it prints out the shortest path from point 1 to point 2 by character 'o'.
```
./my_mouse path_to_a_map_file
```
